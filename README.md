## Project Overview
This Restaurant Management System is a Python script designed to manage various aspects of a restaurant's operations, enhancing both customer and staff experiences. It utilizes a JSON-based menu structure for easy management and manipulation.


## Installation
This project requires Python 3.12.1 or later.
To set up the project:
1. Ensure Python 3.12.1 or a later version is installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

         git clone https://github.com/jaiswalchitransh/Restaurant-Management-System.git

3. Open the project in your preferred Python environment (e.g., IDE or terminal).
4. Run the script (`restaurant.py`) and observe the output.


## Usage
Run the script:

      python restaurant.py
  
Upon running the script, users are greeted with a welcoming interface providing options for menu display, item ordering, addition of new items, rating of items, and exiting the program. Detailed functionalities include:
- **Show Menu**: Displays a list of items with their respective prices and average ratings.
- **Order Items**: Allows users to select items by their IDs and quantity, calculates the total bill, and displays a summary of the order.
- **Add Item**: Enables restaurant staff to add new menu items, specifying name, price, and type (vegetarian or non-vegetarian).
- **Add Ratings**: Allows customers to provide ratings (1-5 stars) for menu items, which are stored and used for item popularity and quality assessment.
- **Exit**: Saves any changes made to the menu and exits the program.


## Features
- **Menu Management**: Utilizes JSON for efficient storage and management of menu items, including name, price, and type.
- **Dynamic Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction with menu items, ordering, and rating.
- **Rating System**: Incorporates a feedback mechanism where customers can rate menu items, helping in understanding customer preferences and improving dish popularity.
- **Data Persistence**: Updates and saves changes to the menu in a JSON file (`menu.json`) for persistent storage.
